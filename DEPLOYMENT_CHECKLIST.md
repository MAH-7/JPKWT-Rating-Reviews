# Deployment Checklist for Improved JPK Rating & Reviews

## âœ… Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Environment Variables
- [ ] **Frontend Service** (jpkwt-rating-reviews-1):
  - `VITE_API_URL` = `https://jpkwt-rating-reviews.onrender.com`

- [ ] **Backend Service** (jpkwt-rating-reviews):
  - `DATABASE_URL` = Your Neon PostgreSQL URL
  - `NODE_ENV` = `production`

### 2. Code Changes Applied
- [ ] Fixed frontend-backend API connection
- [ ] Added health check endpoint (`/api/health`)
- [ ] Implemented keep-alive functionality
- [ ] Added error boundary components
- [ ] Improved loading states
- [ ] Enhanced error handling
- [ ] Added proper TypeScript types

## ðŸš€ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Update Frontend Environment
1. Go to Render Dashboard
2. Navigate to `jpkwt-rating-reviews-1` service
3. Go to Environment tab
4. Add/Update: `VITE_API_URL` = `https://jpkwt-rating-reviews.onrender.com`
5. Save changes

### Step 2: Deploy Backend First
1. Commit and push changes to your repository
2. Render will auto-deploy the backend service
3. Wait for backend deployment to complete
4. Test health endpoint: `https://jpkwt-rating-reviews.onrender.com/api/health`

### Step 3: Deploy Frontend
1. Frontend will auto-deploy after backend
2. Test the application at: `https://jpkwt-rating-reviews-1.onrender.com`

## ðŸ§ª Post-Deployment Testing

### Backend API Tests
- [ ] Health check: `GET /api/health`
- [ ] Get approved reviews: `GET /api/reviews/approved`
- [ ] Get review stats: `GET /api/reviews/stats`
- [ ] Create new review: `POST /api/reviews`

### Frontend Tests
- [ ] Homepage loads without errors
- [ ] Reviews are displayed correctly
- [ ] Review form works
- [ ] Admin panel accessible at `/admin`
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Keep-alive is working (check network tab after 10 mins)

### Error Handling Tests
- [ ] Disconnect internet â†’ Should show error message
- [ ] Navigate to non-existent page â†’ Should show 404
- [ ] Submit invalid review data â†’ Should show validation errors

## ðŸ”§ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Frontend can't connect to Backend
**Symptoms**: Console errors about CORS or network failures
**Solution**: 
1. Verify `VITE_API_URL` is set correctly
2. Check backend service is running
3. Test backend health endpoint directly

#### Backend sleeping (Free Tier)
**Symptoms**: First request takes 15+ seconds
**Solution**: 
1. Keep-alive should prevent this
2. Check browser console for keep-alive logs
3. Consider upgrading to paid tier for instant response

#### Reviews not loading
**Symptoms**: Empty review list or loading forever
**Solution**:
1. Check database connection
2. Verify API endpoints are working
3. Check browser network tab for failed requests

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring

### What to Monitor
- [ ] Backend uptime and response times
- [ ] Frontend loading performance
- [ ] Error rates and types
- [ ] Database query performance

### Render Dashboard Metrics
- Check CPU and memory usage
- Monitor request counts
- Review error logs

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps (Optional)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Enable compression on backend
- [ ] Add database indexing
- [ ] Implement query caching
- [ ] Optimize bundle size

### Security Improvements
- [ ] Add rate limiting
- [ ] Implement proper admin authentication
- [ ] Add input sanitization
- [ ] Set up HTTPS redirects

### Feature Enhancements
- [ ] Add search and filtering
- [ ] Implement bulk actions in admin
- [ ] Add email notifications
- [ ] Create review analytics dashboard

## ðŸ†˜ Rollback Plan

If something goes wrong:

1. **Quick Fix**: Revert environment variables
2. **Code Issues**: Revert to previous commit and redeploy
3. **Database Issues**: Check Neon dashboard for connection issues
